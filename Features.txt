Auto-regressive model coefficient values
(Shannon) Entropy values; entropy values can be taken as a measure of complexity of the signal.
Statistical features like:
    variance
    standard deviation
    Mean
    Median
    25th percentile value
    75th percentile value
    Root Mean Square value; square of the average of the squared amplitude values
    The mean of the derivative
    Zero crossing rate, i.e. the number of times a signal crosses y = 0
    Mean crossing rate, i.e. the number of times a signal crosses y = mean(y)
